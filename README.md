# pipes
Pipes is a framework we use at Fajurion to handle real-time messaging for our chat app. It works across multiple nodes with multiple servers for ultimate
scalability. It currently works with UDP and WebSockets. There is still some need for performance improvements in the future, but it will be fine for small applications.
